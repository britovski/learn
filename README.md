Then it is explained how to gain more performance using register forwarding. Finally, branch prediction is introduced, from the simplest static branch prediction to more elaborate ones (gshare). The effect of the different optimizations are demonstrated using different codes (the classical dhrystones and coremark benchmarks, and a program that computes an image using raytracing).<i><br><br><ins>Topics</ins>: Digital desgin, FPGA, C Programming, RISC-V assembly<br><ins>Requirements</ins>: It is highly recommended to read [episode I](#bruno-levy-episode-1) before episode II !</i>| <a href="https://github.com/BrunoLevy/learn-fpga/blob/master/FemtoRV/TUTORIALS/FROM_BLINKER_TO_RISCV/PIPELINE.md" target="_blank">[GitHub]</a>| 2024-01-10 |
